# Modeling Forest Mortality in Rhode Island

This repository supports the research conducted in the second chapter of my doctoral dissertation, 
Enhancing Forest Monitoring and Management in Southern New England Through GIS Analysis, Remote Sensing, and Predictive Models. 
The focus of this chapter is on modeling forest mortality in Rhode Island, utilizing geospatial analysis, remote sensing data,
and machine learning models to identify areas of tree canopy loss and predict future patterns of mortality.

Contains datasets used in the analysis, including:
  Environmental Variables: Climate, soil properties, elevation, and other ecological layers.
  Defoliation Maps: Raster layers derived from remote sensing (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2).
  Field Validation Data: Ground truth data for validating tree mortality classifications.
